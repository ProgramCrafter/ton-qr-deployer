# ton-qr-deployer
Contract deployment on TON using only QRs.  
Can be accessed on https://ratingers.pythonanywhere.com/deployer/.

## Functions
There is exactly one function - deploy contracts. Enter code BOC and data BOC into their fields, submit transaction, and the contract is ready!

It's useful for development when your BOC changes often so minimizing click numbers is important.

If you want to use project locally, you can, and it requires no installation. Though, it's recommended to access the HTML page through some server, to avoid possible network issues because of browser security policies.
