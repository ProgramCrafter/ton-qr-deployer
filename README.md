# ton-web-deployer
Tool for deploying TON contracts manually. Supports deploying via QR codes (ton:// links).  
Can be accessed on https://ratingers.pythonanywhere.com/deployer/.

Powered by Svelte.

## Functions
There is exactly one function - deploy contracts. Enter code BOC and data BOC into their fields, submit transaction, and the contract is ready!

It's useful for development when your BOC changes often so minimizing click numbers is important.

If you want to use project locally, you can do that, and it requires no installation. Though, it's recommended to serve the HTML page via local server, to avoid possible network issues because of browser security policies.
